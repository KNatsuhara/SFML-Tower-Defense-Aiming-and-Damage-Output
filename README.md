# SFML-Tower-Defense-Aiming-and-Damage-Output
This program implements the SFML library and then initializes a tower and enemies to move along the board so that the tower may shoot the enemies as they are going from left to right across the screen. The tower has a certain range on where the enemies may shoot and when the enemies become in range of the tower, the tower then shoots projectiles on the nearest enemy. The console outputs the health of the enemy that the the tower is shooting and as the enemy loses health, the enemy's color becomes a darker shade.
